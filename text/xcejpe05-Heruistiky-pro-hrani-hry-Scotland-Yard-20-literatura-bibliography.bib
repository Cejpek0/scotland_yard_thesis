 abstract = {
This classic book is an introduction to dynamic programming,
presented by the scientist who coined the term and developed the
theory in its early stages. In Dynamic Programming,
Richard E. Bellman introduces his groundbreaking theory and
furnishes a new and versatile mathematical tool for the treatment
of many complex problems, both within and outside of the
discipline. The book is written at a moderate mathematical level,
requiring only a basic foundation in mathematics, including
calculus. The applications formulated and analyzed in such diverse
fields as mathematical economics, logistics, scheduling theory,
communication theory, and control processes are as relevant today
as they were when Bellman first presented them. A new introduction
by Stuart Dreyfus reviews Bellman's later work on dynamic
programming and identifies important research areas that have
profited from the application of Bellman's theory.

    abstract = {The trade-off between the need to obtain new knowledge and the need to use that knowledge to improve performance is one of the most basic trade-offs in nature, and optimal performance usually requires some balance between exploratory and exploitative behaviors. Researchers in many disciplines have been searching for the optimal solution to this dilemma. Here we present a novel model in which the exploration strategy itself is dynamic and varies with time in order to optimize a definite goal, such as the acquisition of energy, money, or prestige. Our model produced four very distinct phases: Knowledge establishment, Knowledge accumulation, Knowledge maintenance, and Knowledge exploitation, giving rise to a multidisciplinary framework that applies equally to humans, animals, and organizations. The framework can be used to explain a multitude of phenomena in various disciplines, such as the movement of animals in novel landscapes, the most efficient resource allocation for a start-up company, or the effects of old age on knowledge acquisition in humans.},
